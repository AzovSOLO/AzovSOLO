👋 Hi, I'm @AzovSOLO

👀 I'm interested in technology, programming, and exploring the endless possibilities that the world of software development has to offer.

🌱 I'm currently learning and expanding my skills in Python, with a particular focus on creating Telegram bots. Additionally, I'm also delving into the worlds of C# and C++ to broaden my programming horizons.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on exciting and innovative projects that challenge me to grow as a developer and provide solutions to real-world problems.
